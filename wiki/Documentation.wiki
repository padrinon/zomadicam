= Introduction =

ZomadiCAM: A SketchUp to Shopbot Partfile generator.


= Quick Start - Transform Model directly to Partfile =

 * Copy the Zomadic plugins into the Google Sketchup plugins folder.

 * Be sure you are on a PC and have created C:\SbParts\

 * Launch Sketchup and menu select File->3D Warehouse->Get Models...

 * Search for the Collection Zomadicam and download the Virtual Shopbot directly into your model.

 * After importing the Virtual Shopbot you *must* explode the Virtual Shopbot Model *one* time. This step will be soon deprecated. This because Sketchup automatically wraps the component in a new generic component and we don't want that.

 * Download another model from the 3D-Warehouse::ZomadiCAM Collection.

 * Select the model and menu select Plugins::Zomadic Tools::ZomadiCAM::Transform Model directly to Partfile. Follow the dialogs.

 * The Shopbot Partfile for the model should have been written into the C:\SbParts\ folder.





= Creating Partfile from primitive Geometry =

You may also simply create partfiles based upon Sketchup geometry which is not necessarily a part of a model. There are two main steps

  ==Translate Geometry to Toolpath==
 # Make sure the geometry is wrapped within a component
 # Select the geometry you wish to write to a partfile
 * Menu-select Plugins->Zomadic Tools->ZomadiCAM->transform selected Geometry to Toolpath
This will create a toolpath of the selected geometry in the toolpath layer.
  ==Translate Toolpath to Partfile==
 # Select the Toolpath components you wish to write to the partfile
 # Menu-select Plugins->Zomadic Tools->ZomadiCAM->write selected toolpath geometry to Partfile
